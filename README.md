# Image Encryption Tool

The Image Encryption Tool is a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple mathematical operation with a key. This tool can be used to protect sensitive images by encrypting them before transmission or storage.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypts images using a specified key, making them unreadable without decryption.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts previously encrypted images using the same key.
- **Key-based Security:** Uses a key to encrypt and decrypt images, providing a level of security against unauthorized access.
- **Support for Various Image Formats:** Supports common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

## Usage

1. Run the `image_encryption_tool.py` script using Python.
2. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt an image by entering 'e' for encryption, 'd' for decryption, or 'q' to quit.
3. If encrypting, enter the encryption key and the location or URL of the image you want to encrypt.
4. If decrypting, enter the decryption key and the location of the encrypted image.
5. The program will encrypt or decrypt the image and save the result in the same directory as the original image.
